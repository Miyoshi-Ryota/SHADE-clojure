# shade

A Clojure library designed to optimize function by SHADE(Success-History Based Parameter Adaptation for Differential Evolution).
SHADE was proposed below a paper.

`Tanabe, Ryoji, and Alex Fukunaga. "Success-history based parameter adaptation for differential evolution." In 2013 IEEE congress on evolutionary computation, pp. 71-78. IEEE, 2013.`

As far as I know, SHADE is one of the best optimization algorithm for function optimization which means single objective 
and continuous problems.
